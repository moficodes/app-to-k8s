# Setup

## Setup Steps

In this section, you will create your own IBM Cloud account, and then get access to a IBM Cloud Lab account which contains pre-provisioned clusters. Each lab attendee will be granted access to one cluster.

## Create your IBM Cloud account <a id="create-your-ibm-cloud-account"></a>

​[Sign up for IBM Cloud​](https://ibm.biz/Bd2Lri)

## Get a Kubernetes Cluster <a id="get-a-kubernetes-cluster"></a>

Generally to get started with Kubernetes, the first step is to provision a cluster which can take up to 10 minutes. In addition, free clusters come with limited features and a single worker VM/node. For this workshop, we've created Standard \(paid\) clusters with full Kubernetes functionality.

To get a cluster, head to the [Get Cluster](https://app-to-k8s.mybluemix.net/) tool.

Use the key `k8s_rocks_2019` and input the email you used to sign up for IBM Cloud. Ensure that US East is chosen as we've created clusters in the Washington data center for this lab.
