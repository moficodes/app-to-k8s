The application we are building today is a number sequence generator. 

Given a number it generates 3 sequences \(fibonacci, prime and factorial\). Its not all that interesting, but for learning k8s basics it will do. 

The app is made up of 4 microservices. If you don't know what a microservice is, thats fine. All you need to know is that it's a single application doing a single thing. Microservice architecture plays really nicely with k8s.
