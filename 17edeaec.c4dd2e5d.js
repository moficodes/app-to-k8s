One could build immutable virtual-machine images in order to achieve predictable rollouts and rollbacks, but VMs are heavyweight and non-portable. The ",Object(o.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"New Way")," is to deploy containers based on operating-system-level virtualization rather than hardware virtualization. These containers are isolated from each other and from the host: they have their own filesystems, they can\u2019t see each others\u2019 processes, and their computational resource usage can be bounded. They are easier to build than VMs, and because they are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure and from the host filesystem, they are portable across clouds and OS distributions. Because containers are small and fast, one application can be packed in each container image. This one-to-one application-to-image relationship unlocks the full benefits of containers. With containers, immutable container images can be created at build/release time rather than deployment time, since each application doesn\u2019t need to be composed with the rest of the application stack, nor married to the production infrastructure environment. Generating container images at build/release time enables a consistent environment to be carried from development into production. Similarly, containers are vastly more transparent than VMs, which facilitates monitoring and management. This is especially true when the containers\u2019 process lifecycles are managed by the infrastructure rather than hidden by a process supervisor inside the container.

If you want to communicate with a service running in a pod, you have to open up a channel for communication. This is referred to as ingress. There are multiple ways to add ingress to your cluster. The most common ways are by adding either an ",Object(o.b)("a",Object(n.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/"}),"Ingress")," controller, or a ",Object(o.b)("a",Object(n.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/"}),"LoadBalancer"),". The exact tradeoffs between these two options are out of scope for this post, but you must be aware that ingress is something you need to handle before you can experiment with Kubernetes."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},137:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return u})),a.d(t,"b",(function(){return h}));var n=a(0),o=a.n(n);function r(e,t,a){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:a,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=a,e}function s(e,t){var a=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(n=n.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),a.push.apply(a,n)}return a}function i(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var a=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?s(Object(a),!0).forEach((function(t){r(e,t,a[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(a)):s(Object(a)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(a,t))}))}return e}function l(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,o=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,o={},r=Object.keys(e);for(n=0;n<r.length;n++)a=r[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||(o[a]=e[a]);return o}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(n=0;n<r.length;n++)a=r[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,a)&&(o[a]=e[a])}return o}var c=o.a.createContext({}),d=function(e){var t=o.a.useContext(c),a=t;return e&&(a="function"==typeof e?e(t):i(i({},t),e)),a},u=function(e){var t=d(e.components);return o.a.createElement(c.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},b={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,{},t)}},p=o.a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var a=e.components,n=e.mdxType,r=e.originalType,s=e.parentName,c=l(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),u=d(a),p=n,h=u["".concat(s,".").concat(p)]||u[p]||b[p]||r;return a?o.a.createElement(h,i(i({ref:t},c),{},{components:a})):o.a.createElement(h,i({ref:t},c))}));function h(e,t){var a=arguments,n=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||n){var r=a.length,s=new Array(r);s[0]=p;var i={};for(var l in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,l)&&(i[l]=t[l]);i.originalType=e,i.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:n,s[1]=i;for(var c=2;c<r;c++)s[c]=a[c];return o.a.createElement.apply(null,s)}return o.a.createElement.apply(null,a)}p.displayName="MDXCreateElement"},138:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a(0),o=a(37);t.a=function(){return Object(n.useContext)(o.a)}},141:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return r}));var n=a(138),o=a(143);function r(e,{forcePrependBaseUrl:t=!1,absolute:a=!1}={}){const{siteConfig:{baseUrl:r="/",url:s}={}}=Object(n.a)();if(!e)return e;if(t)return r+e;if(!Object(o.a)(e))return e;const i=r+e.replace(/^\//,"");return a?s+i:i}},143:function(e,t,a){"use strict";function n(e){return!1===/^(https?:|\/\/|mailto:|tel:)/.test(e)}a.d(t,"a",(function(){return n}))}}]);
